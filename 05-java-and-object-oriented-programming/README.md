# Intro to Java and Object-Oriented Programming Exercises

The exercises in this project are designed to help you understand the basics of Java and Object-Oriented Programming.

## Getting Started

To get started, open the project file located in `java-and-object-oriented-programming/pom.xml` in IntelliJ.

## Exercises

The exercises for this project are all methods in the `src/main/java/org.example/src/Exercises` class.
Each method has a comment above it that describes what the method should do. Your job is to write the
code that makes the method do what the comment describes.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, right-click on the `test/java/org.example/src/ExercisesTest` class and select "Run 'ExercisesTest'".
This will run all of the tests for the exercises. When a test succeeds, you will see a green checkmark next to the test.
When a test fails, you will see a red X next to the test.  Once all of the tests pass, you have completed the exercises.
