# Data Structures

The exercises in this project are designed to help you understand common data structures in Java.

## Getting Started

To get started, open the project file located in `data-structures/pom.xml` in IntelliJ.

## Project Overview 

This project contains a `Main` class that contains several methods that demonstrate various data
structures in java. To complete this exercise you will need to follow the `TODO` comments in the `Main` class
and implement the methods as described.

The `ExerciseTests` class contains tests for the `Main` class.

## Exercise

To complete this exercise, you will need to follow the `TODO` comments in the `Main` class

## Running the Tests

As always, final verification of your code should be done by running the unit tests.

To run the tests, right-click on the `test/java/org.example/src/ExerciseTests` class and select "Run 'ExercisesTests'".
This will run all of the tests for the exercises. When a test succeeds, you will see a green checkmark next to the test.
When a test fails, you will see a red X next to the test.  Once all of the tests pass, you have completed the exercises.
